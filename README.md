# Reinforcement Learning Cryptography in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

by Faris Sbahi -- final project for CS 590: Reinforcement Learning by [Prof. Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/)

A project inspired by Google Brain's work regarding using neural networks to protect communications. Here, we seek to use reinforcement learning as an alternative model.

> In this setting, we model attackers by neural networks; alternative models may perhaps
be enabled by reinforcement learning.
